# Configuring Email Service With AWS SES

This project demonstrate the pattern to creating email service with proper domain name
and having it verified for AWS SES via AWS CDK as the infra code.

## The Design



The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
